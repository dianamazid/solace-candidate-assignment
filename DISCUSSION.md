For this assignment, I updated page.tsx with bug fixes and UI improvements, such as cleaning up the input button, spacing. In addition, I updated the reset functionailty to work properly, styled the table headers and rows for clarity. I added a hover effect on rows for interactivity and updated the search so it was not case sensitive. Lastly fixed the direct DOM manipulation. I left comments brief comments to things I changed to make improvements. If I had more time, I would add pagination to the table to make it more readable, especially when using the database with tons more search options. I would also add more UI functionality such as highlighting matching terms in search results for better user experience.
